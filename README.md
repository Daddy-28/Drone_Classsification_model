This project focuses on developing a deep learning-based classification model designed to predict the model type, maneuvering direction, and fault type of drones using audio files. The model leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and multi-task learning to achieve high accuracy in these predictions.

# Project_Overview
The primary goal of this project is to accurately classify drone audio data into three categories:

1) Model Type: Identifying the specific model of the drone.
2) Maneuvering Direction: Determining the direction in which the drone is moving.
3) Fault Type: Detecting any faults in the drone's operation.

# Installation
User must have proper jupyter notebook environment installed on device, can refer anaconda navigator for that.
Some standard libraries likr NumPy, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, Lirosa etc. must be installed on jupyter notebook to run the model effectively.
